# Automated Reporting
Automatically generate reports based on an updated excel spreadsheet
This script automatically generates a word document based on an excel spreadsheet. This is a project that requires reporting on work carried out at regular intervals.
Project staff update a shared excel spreadsheet and then this script automatically reads it and generates a report of the activity for the date period selected. I have
created a tkinter GUI to go with the script where you just selecte the date range. Pictures are inserted into the word document at regular intervals as this is one of the
requirements from the client.

This report generator automatically creates:
1) Charts and tables that are needed by the client
2) New text that corresponds to the updates made to the database
3) Photos taken by team members
4) Summary text of the outcomes of the preceeding report period

I have not uploaded the database or a sample of the database as it contains confidential information belonging to the client. I have removed all information from this
script that would identify the project, client or location where this work is carried out. 

Here's a screen shot of the GUI:
